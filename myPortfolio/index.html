        <h2>Aspiring Software Engineer</h2>
        <p id="paraFont">Thank you for visiting my portfolio page.  Again, my name is Whitney-Rene, and I am an aspiring software engineer.  I am currently a part of a 6 month with an organization called Techtonica.  Techtonica's mission is to bridge the gap between women of color and the tech industry.  I could not be happier to be a participant in the 2023 H2 Co-Hort. In my free time, I enjoy being outside, connecting with friends and painting my nails!  Please feel free to browse around my webpage.  My contact is listed below.  And please fill out the form below.  I would love to connect! </p>
